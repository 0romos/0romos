## 1.0 About me
I am oromos, 19 years old, currently majoring in Cyber Security, Computer/Data Science, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Robotics. My aspiration is to work at organizations like the NSA or IC3 as a Security Researcher and at companies like Google, Facebook, or Apple as a Security researcher. I am constantly engaged in new projects, regardless of their level of difficulty and frequently generate fresh ideas for my work.

Presently, my focus lies in low-level development and participation in Capture The Flag and King Of The Hill events, essentially anything related to low-level development and hacking. Over the past five years, I have participated in various Bug Bounties for numerous companies, where I’ve discovered and reported bugs, exploits, and 0days for platforms such as Discord, Instagram, Sleek, Twitter, Lieferando, OBS, and even government websites. Some proof of concepts and exploits can be found on my YouTube channel and Github repositories. Additionally, I have participated in several cybersecurity events throughout my journey.

I am always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new collaborators. Feel free to check out my repositories, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you would like to collaborate on any of my existing projects or if you think I would be a good fit for your project. I appreciate every piece of information I receive and am always eager to learn about things I don’t know.
